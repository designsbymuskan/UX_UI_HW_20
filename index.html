                It was from this wealth of data and user feedback that we identified a clear problem statement. Our research illuminated a central issue that required addressing to enhance NABA's online presence. This problem statement became the foundation for our project, guiding our design and development efforts.

            <p>
                To ensure an exceptional user experience for NABA, we actively sought and embraced user feedback. One significant iteration involved our homepage design. Initially, we included a prominent donation pop-up to encourage financial support. However, after user interviews, we adjusted our approach based on feedback: users preferred exploring and learning about the organization before encountering donation requests. As a result, we reduced the prominence of the donation pop-up and focused on providing a clear and engaging introduction to NABA's mission and offerings. This change underscores our commitment to user-centered design, enhancing the website's effectiveness.

                We made a significant improvement on the quiz page, responding to user feedback that indicated an opportunity to enhance engagement. Initially lacking visual elements, we added small images and icons, enriching the user experience and increasing engagement.
